This script parses a CSV file containing your order history on Amazon.com, and loads it into `Order` and `Item` objects.

Currently it only gives you a) a breakdown of expenditures per category and b) total money spent at Amazon.com in your lifetime, but that'll be improved. Feel free to send pull requests!

# Obtaining your Amazon history

On your Amazon.com account page, click "Download order reports":

Fill the form out to get the interval desired. I personally like getting everything; for that, you'd set the start date as January 1st of whatever earlier year it gives you, and then click "Use today" for the end date.

Click requests report; it'll take Amazon some time to process, and then you'll get a link by email to download your report.

Place it in the same folder as this script, rename it to `amazon.csv`, and you can run the script!
